# Module

# Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code that can define functions, classes, and varia- bles.

# In general, these statements are defined at the top of the calling modules, for example: “import os”.
# This will make functions available that are located in the operating system (os) module (Beazley & Jones, 2013).
