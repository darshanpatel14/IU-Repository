# Data visualization is an important step in any data statistical analysis or machine learning project (McKinney, 2017).
# This visualization is generally presented using maps or graphs.
# It helps to see and understand the data so patterns, trends, and outliers
# can be detected early.
# Below are the three most used data visualization ecosystem libraries in Python:
# 1. Matplotlib 2. Seaborn 3. Bokeh
